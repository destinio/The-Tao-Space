            Unnamed Tao it's just another word for spiritual experiences
          </span>
          <span>To understand the Tao one must partake of it's nature.</span>
          <span>
            Desire is the thing that blocks us from experiencing the unnameable
            part of the Tao
          </span>
          <span>
            To see the nameless part of the Tao, we must think and act like the
            Tao
          </span>
          <span>
            To see the Material (Named) side of the Tao. Is to live in our lives
            without growth

        <span>Opposites - two parts of the same thing</span>
