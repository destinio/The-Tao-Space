            We also lead our selves. We are both, at one point or another, both
            leaders and followers
          </span>
          <span>
            remember to practice this chapter as both the leader and the
            follower
          </span>
          <span>As a follower, don't overvalue the result of an ambition.</span>
          <span>we influence others</span>

            Do not show off your possessions, knowledge or abilities that are
            hard to produce or procure. Or, your followers will seek to have the
            same.
          </span>
          <span>
            The wise keep the people free of bad ambition. We want to serve
            those that we are leading. Or, protect those that follow/look up to
            us. Don't make those that follow serve.
          </span>
          <span>
            Do not bring your ego into anything when leading. Or the followers
            will seek to have and please the leader. This quiets their minds and
            desires to please and let's them focus. Be at peace.
          </span>
          <span>keep others from having greedy ambition.</span>
